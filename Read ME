# README

A quick guide to running the frame streamer backend and web dashboard.

---

## 1. Start the Python Backend

1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
This will:

Capture video frames and display them in your terminal.(This is will  send on the local host i think port 5000 so anyone with link could see the JSON)

Send each frame via HTTP to the configured endpoint.

Auto-restart on failure
If the stream stops or you see errors, press Ctrl + R in your editor/terminal. The script watcher will detect the change and restart main.py automatically.

2. Launch the Web Dashboard
Open index.html in your browser to view the live dashboard.

For development

In VS Code, right-click index.html â†’ Open with Live Server
